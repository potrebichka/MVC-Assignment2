Assignment:

Receive the "amount" value as input from query string. For example, the url is "localhost:1234/home/index?amount=60743".

Based on the given "amount" value, generate the highest currency denominations.

Consider, you have denominations of 1000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 5, and 1.

For example, if the input is "60743", output should be:

1000 X 60 = 60000

500 X 1 = 500

100 X 2 = 200

10 X 4 = 40

1 X 3 = 3

Display the denominations in a dynamic table, along with respective currency note's image.
